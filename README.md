## Installation
First up, make sure you have python installed, recommended 3.9.x, others may work.  
Then either download the source, or git clone if you know how to.  
After that, open up `install.bat` to install all the requirements.  
And then you can run `run.bat`, to set tokens for what you want goto `src/data/<what your using>` and add your tokens in the tokens.txt file.
